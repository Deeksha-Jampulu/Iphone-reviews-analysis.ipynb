    "- **Strong Negative Emotions**: Words like *\"worst\"*, *\"bad\"*, *\"poor\"*, and *\"disappointed\"* were prominent — indicating **deep dissatisfaction** in some user segments.\n",
    "- **Camera & Performance Issues**: The appearance of *\"camera\"*, *\"performance\"*, and *\"screen\"* in negative reviews suggests **inconsistent hardware or software experiences**, depending on user expectations.\n",
